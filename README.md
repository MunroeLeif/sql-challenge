# sql-challenge
This is a research project into the employee data of a fictional company's employee database from the 1980's and 1990's. 

# About
For this project, I designed the tables to hold the data from the six CSV files that comprised the employee database, and imported that data into an SQL database. This is found in the Employee_schema.sql file. Finally, I answered data analysis questions about the employee database, found in the Employee_queries.sql file.
